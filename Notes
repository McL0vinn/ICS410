Book 1
Actuator is the true bridge between cyber and physical
Supervisory system is usually something that allows humans to  supervise the control loop ( but can also be something non-human e.g server)
Jitter = intermittent/ infrequent / incosistent delay
The Purdue Model does NOT have security reccomendations
ISA/IEC 62443 ( a family of documents) is the international standard body for reccomendation how to do Cybersecurity in OT systems
DCS use controllers, PLC ARE controllers. But they can both be assumed to be Controllers.There are lots of devices that act as controllers and are neither a DCS or a PLC.
Basic I/O = no protocols involved, one wire per sensor/actuator, raw measurements across the wire.
Smart I/O =  intelligence involved, fieldbus protocols , 
Anything speaking fieldbus protocols, means it has firmware thus attackable.

Controller talking to Controller / field device = fieldbus protocol
Supervisory talking to Supervisory / Controller = SCADA protocol
